# Awesome Observability

High [Signal-to-noise ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio) tagged list of the best references for monitoring and observability

My current idea is to build up a YAML list of documents that store
- title
- description?
- url
- tags?

And from that we can generate:
- [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)-style README's to
  browse in GitHub
- A pretty GitHub Pages site that you can filter by different tags and
  filter by name/description easily for the same links.

I'm not sure I should separate propietary products, open standards, open
source projects, and interesting slides/presentations, but if we tag
them all then it might be easy to hide some by default, etc.
