# This is the source of truth for the README.md and GitHub pages website.
#
# We have some basic metadata, and then the actual data. I think it'd be
# awesome to have a list of kinds of links and allowed tags. We can allow
# other tags, but warn on them while generating the website and README.
#
# We should also probably talk a bit about some subjective stuff, like the
# difference between monitoring and observability, and why they matter:
# - monitoring vs observability
# - the three pillars?
# - how does APM fit in the picture?
